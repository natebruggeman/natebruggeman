Hey, thanks for stopping by my github page, my name is Nate Bruggeman.

You're probably here because I applied to your company, thank you for taking an interest in me!

I'm currently sharpening my React.js and Node.js skills, building mostly smaller applications.

My goal right now is to land a new Front End or Full Stack Developer job with a great company. 

You can best reach me at njbruggeman@gmail.com or 224-567-9967. 

Thanks!!
Nate
